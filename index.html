  <h1>About astronauts</h1>
  <p> astronaut (from the Greek "astron" (ἄστρον), meaning "star", and "nautes" (ναύτης), meaning "sailor") is a person trained, equipped, and
      deployed by a human spaceflight program to serve as a commander or crew member aboard a spacecraft. Although generally reserved for
       professional space travelers, the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including scientists, politicians, 
       journalists and tourists.

    "Astronaut" technically applies to all human space travelers regardless of nationality or allegiance; however, astronauts fielded by 
    Russia or the Soviet Union are typically known instead as cosmonauts (from the Russian "kosmos" (космос), meaning "space", also borrowed
     from Greek) in order to distinguish them from American or otherwise NATO-oriented space travellers.[3] Comparatively recent 
     developments in manned spaceflight made by China has led to the rise of the term taikonaut (from the Mandarin "tàikōng" (太空人),
      meaning "space"), although its use is somewhat informal and its origin is unclear. In Mainland China, the People's Liberation
       Army Astronaut Corps astronauts and their foreign counterparts are all officially called hángtiānyuán (航天员, meaning "heaven 
       navigator" or literally "heaven-sailing staff") and "astronauts" in English.
    
    Until 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments,
     either by the military or by civilian space agencies. With the suborbital flight of
      the privately funded SpaceShipOne in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the commercial astronaut.</p></div>

      <h2>Who was the first astronaut?</h2>
      <p>The first astronaut was either the Soviet Yuri Gagarin or the Soviet dog Laika, depending on whether the definition is restricted 
          based on species. Both are remembered for their accomplishments and contributions to space travel.The first astronaut, Yuri Gagarin.

        Laika, a name that literally means "barker" and was based on her breed, was launched into space on 3 November 1957 on board Sputnik 2,
         becoming the first animal to orbit the Earth. This took place only a month after the first satellite, Sputnik, was launched, on 4 
         October 1957. Sputnik 2 was the second spacecraft launched into Earth orbit.

        <h3>Who was the first astronaut on the moon?</h3>
        <p>Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut and aeronautical engineer, and the first person
     to walk on the Moon. He was also a naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor. A graduate of Purdue University, Armstrong 
     studied aeronautical engineering; his college tuition was paid for by the U.S. Navy under the Holloway Plan. He became a midshipman
      in 1949 and a naval aviator the following year. He saw action in the Korean War, flying the Grumman F9F Panther from the aircraft 
      carrier USS Essex. In September 1951, while making a low bombing run, Armstrong's aircraft was damaged when it collided with an 
      anti-aircraft cable, strung across a valley, which cut off a large portion of one wing. Armstrong was forced to bail out. After the war,
      he completed his bachelor's degree at Purdue and became a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics 
      (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base in California. He was the project pilot on Century Series fighters 
      and flew the North American X-15 seven times. He was also a participant in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20
       Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs.
            
            Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in the second group, which was selected in 1962. He made his first 
            spaceflight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space.
             During this mission with pilot David Scott, he performed the first docking of two spacecraft; the mission was aborted
              after Armstrong used some of his re-entry control fuel to stabilize a dangerous roll caused by a stuck thruster.
               During training for Armstrong's second and last spaceflight as commander of Apollo 11, he had to eject from the 
               Lunar Landing Research Vehicle moments before a crash.
            
            On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Apollo 11 Lunar Module (LM) pilot Buzz Aldrin became the first people to land on the Moon,
             and the next day they spent two and a half hours outside the Lunar Module Eagle spacecraft while Michael Collins remained 
             in lunar orbit in the Apollo Command Module Columbia. When Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said:
              "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the 
              Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon. President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong with the Congressional 
              Space Medal of Honor in 1978, and Armstrong and his former crewmates received a Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.
            
            After he resigned from NASA in 1971, Armstrong taught in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University 
            of Cincinnati until 1979. He served on the Apollo 13 accident investigation and on the Rogers Commission, which investigated 
            the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster</p></div>
